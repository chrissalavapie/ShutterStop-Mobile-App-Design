An original mobile product and design. 

## Mobile App Brief: 
This app lets people randomly generate an itinerary for the day â€“ where to go, what to do, and what to eat! The app supplements the random generation with specific suggestions for each category based on where you live. It will serve a community that likes to go out and preoccupy themselves with activities, but is indecisive and has trouble figuring out how to make the most of their day. This may also be beneficial for people encouraging themselves to get out of their shell and need some inspiration to start their journey and explore new hobbies. This app unburdens users from having to do their own research and saves them from wasting time on debating their itinerary instead of doing said activities. The randomness of the draw also helps users practice opening their mind up to new opportunities.
